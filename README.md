The Prover is a fork of [Iden3's prover-server](https://github.com/iden3/prover-server). It is a REST API Wrapper
for [go-rapidsnark](https://github.com/iden3/go-rapidsnark)

List of implemented features:

### Installation

1. Build prover server:
    ```
    go build ./cmd/prover/prover.go
    ```

3. Put compiled circuits into `<circuitsBasePath>/<circuitName>` directory. Where `<circuitsBasePath>` is config option
   with default value `circuits`, and `<circuitName>` is name of the circuit that will be passed as a param to an API
   call. See [SnarkJS Readme](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) for instructions on how to compile circuits.
